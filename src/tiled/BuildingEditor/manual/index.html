<h2>Autosaving</h2>
To avoid losing too much work in the event the editor crashes, every
2.5 minutes BuildingEd will save the current building if it has unsaved
changes.&nbsp; The name of the auto-saved file will end with the
".autosave" extension.<br>
<ul>
  <li>If the building is new and has never been saved, the autosave
file will be in the .TileZed directory in the user's home
directory.&nbsp; On Windows, this will usually be
C:\Users\USERNAME\.TileZed.&nbsp; The name of the file will be
"untitled.autosave".<br>
  </li>
  <li>If the building was loaded from an existing .tbx file, the name
of the autosave file will be the same as the .tbx file plus ".autosave"
in the same directory as the .tbx file.&nbsp; For example, if the
current building was loaded from "C:\MyBuildings\MyCoolBuilding.tbx",
the autosave file will be named
"C:\MyBuildings\MyCoolBuilding.tbx.autosave".</li>
</ul>
The autosave file will be deleted if the building is saved by the user,
if a new building is created/opened, or if BuildingEd is closed.<br>
