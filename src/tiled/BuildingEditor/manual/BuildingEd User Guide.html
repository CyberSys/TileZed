<h4>Door&nbsp; Tool <img style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" alt="Door tool" src="images/icon_door.png"><br>
</h4>
Use the Door Tool to place a door object.&nbsp; Doors must be placed on
the edge of a grid cell.&nbsp; Door objects have both a door tile and a
door frame tile assigned to them, either of which may be set to
"none".&nbsp; By placing a door on the edge of a room, the correct wall
tile is automatically chosen to leave a hole for the door.<br>
<ul>
<li>Left-click to place a door.&nbsp; When the mouse pointer is near the
left or right edge of a grid cell, the door will be a west- or
east-side door.&nbsp; When the mouse pointer is near the top or bottom edge
of&nbsp; a grid cell, the door will be a north- or south-side door.</li><li>Right-click to delete the door (or any other kind of object) that is under the mouse pointer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Window&nbsp; Tool <img style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" alt="Window tool" src="images/icon_window.png"><br>
</h4>
Use the Window Tool to place a window object.&nbsp; Windows must be
placed on th edge of a grid cell.&nbsp; Window objects have both a
window tile and a curtains tile, either of which may be set to
"none".&nbsp; By placing a window on the edge of a room, the correct
wall tile is automatically chosen to leave a hole for the window.<br>
<ul>
<li>Left-click to place a window.&nbsp; When the mouse pointer is near the
left or right edge of a grid cell, the window will be a west- or east-side window.&nbsp;
When the mouse pointer is near the top or bottom edge of&nbsp; a grid cell,
the window will be a north- or south-side window.</li><li>Right-click to delete the window (or any other kind of object) that is under the mouse pointer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Stairs&nbsp; Tool&nbsp; <img style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" alt="Stairs tool" src="images/icon_stair.png"><br>
</h4>
Use the Stairs Tool to place a staircase object.&nbsp; A staircase is
just tall enough (along the Z-axis) to reach the next floor.&nbsp; By
placing a staircase on a floor, the floor tiles on the floor <span style="font-style: italic;">above</span>
the staircase are erased automatically.&nbsp; Note that there are only
3 tiles in a staircase, but the object itself occupies 5 tiles to
remind you to leave a spot for the player to enter and exit the
staircase.<br>
<ul>
<li>Left-click to place a staircase.&nbsp; When the mouse pointer is near the
left or right edge of a grid cell, the staircase will be horizontal.&nbsp;
When the mouse pointer is near the top or bottom edge of&nbsp; a grid cell,
the staircase will be vertical.</li>
  <li>Right-click to delete the staircase (or any other kind of object) that is under the mouse pointer.</li>
</ul>

<img style="width: 104px; height: 224px;" alt="" src="images/vertical-stairs.png">&nbsp; <img style="width: 126px; height: 160px;" alt="" src="images/vertical-stairs-tiles.png">&nbsp; A vertical staircase.<br>

<h4>Roof Tool&nbsp; <br>
</h4>
Use the roof tool to create roof objects.&nbsp; All roof objects are
created by left-click-dragging to draw a rectangle defining the area of
the roof object.&nbsp; Some roof objects are restricted to how wide or
tall they may be.<br>
<img style="width: 173px; height: 201px;" alt="" src="images/roof-tool.png"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Slope (West) and Slope (East) roof objects may be 1, 2, or 3 tiles wide and any height.<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 554px; height: 180px;" alt="" src="images/roof-slope-west.png"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 632px; height: 206px;" alt="" src="images/roof-slope-east.png"><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
Slope (North) and Slope (South) roof objects may be 1, 2, or 3 tiles tall and any width.<br>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 356px; height: 310px;" alt="" src="images/roof-slope-north.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="width: 447px; height: 311px;" alt="" src="images/roof-slope-south.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
Peak (Vertical) roof objects may be any height and width.&nbsp; When
wider than 6 tiles, the gap is filled in with a flat section.<br>
<img style="width: 1359px; height: 373px;" alt="" src="images/roof-peak-ns.png"><br>
<br>
Peak (Horizontal) roof objects may be any size.&nbsp; When taller than 6 tiles, the gap is filled in with a flat section.<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><img style="width: 1270px; height: 435px;" alt="" src="images/roof-peak-we.png"><br>
<br>
Flat Top roof objects may be any size.&nbsp; The depth along the Z-axis
of Flat Top roof objects can be set to Zero, One, Two, or Three.&nbsp;
When the depth is Zero, the flat top is drawn into the "Floor"
tile-layer of the floor the roof object is on.&nbsp; When the depth is
Three, the flat top is drawn into the "Floor" layer of the floor <span style="font-style: italic;">above</span> the floor the object is on.<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 541px; height: 227px;" alt="" src="images/roof-flat.png"><br>
</div>
<h4>Roof Corner Tool<br>
</h4>
Use the Roof Corner Tool to place roof-corner objects.&nbsp;
Roof-corner objects may be used to join other roof objects together
visually.&nbsp; Roof-corner objects are created by left-click-dragging
to draw a rectangle defining the area of the object.&nbsp; Roof-corner
objects may be 1x1, 2x2, or 3x3 tiles in size.<br>
<img style="width: 140px; height: 219px;" alt="" src="images/roof-corner-tool.png"><br>
Typically, only the Inner (North-West) and Outer (South-East)
roof-corner objects are used, but the other types may be used if you
later want to rotate or flip the building and end up with the correct
appearance for the rotated corners.<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 717px; height: 348px;" alt="" src="images/roof-corners.png"><br>
</div>
<h4>Furniture&nbsp; Tool <img style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" alt="" src="images/icon_furniture.png"><br>
</h4>
Use the Furniture Tool to place furniture objects.&nbsp; Furniture
objects are assigned a "furniture tile" which may be composed of
multiple individual tile images. Some furniture tiles, for example for
a table lamp, have only a single tile image, while other furniture
tiles, such as for a double-bed, have 4 tile images.<br>
<ul>
<li>Left-click to place a furniture object.</li>
  <li>When next to
the edge or corner of a room, the furniture object's orientation will
automatically be chosen.&nbsp; If you want to disable the chosen
orientation, hold down the CTRL key.</li>
  <li>In the corners of a room, 2 possible orientations could be
chosen.&nbsp; The Furniture Tool prefers the north and south
orientations in these cases.&nbsp; To use the alternate (west or east)
orientation, hold down the SHIFT key.&nbsp; Some furniture tiles, such
as for kitchen counters, already have valid corner orientations, in
which case those are used and the SHIFT key does nothing.<br>
  </li>
<li>Right-click to delete the furniture object (or any other kind of object) that is under the mouse pointer.</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 425px; height: 220px;" alt="" src="images/furniture.png"><br>
</div>
<h4>Select and Move Objects Tool&nbsp; <img style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="" src="images/tool-select-objects.png"></h4>
Use the Select and Move Objects Tool to select, deselect, and move
objects.&nbsp; Only objects on the current floor may be selected.&nbsp;
If the current floor changes for any reason, any selected objects are
first deselected.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Left-click on an object to select it, clearing any previous selection.</li>
  <li>SHIFT-left-click on an object to add it to the selection.<br>
  </li>

  <li>CTRL-left-click on an object to add it to the selection if it
wasn't already, or remove it from the selection if it was already
selected.</li>
  <li>Left-click-drag on any selected object to move all the selected objects to a new position.</li>
  <li>Left-click-drag on an unselected object will first clear the
selection, select the clicked object, then drag the clicked object to a
new position.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Left-click-drag
outside any object to draw a selection rectangle.&nbsp; When the left
mouse button is released, any objects touching the selection rectangle
will be affected the same as if clicking on those objects one at a
time. That is, the CTRL key will toggle the selected state of objects
in the selection rectangle, while the SHIFT key will always add
deselected objects to the selection.<br>
</li><li>Right-click while dragging objects to cancel the operation.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 195px; height: 222px;" alt="" src="images/select-objects-tool.png"><br>
</div>
If objects are dragged outside the grid (or to any invalid position), those objects will be deleted.<br>
